# Trigger Short Exercise 2024
Trigger short exercise CMS DAS @ CERN, June 2024

## Jupyter noteboooks

If you want to use Jupyter notebooks on lxplus, please review the content of your `~/.ssh/config` file on your system by executing:

    cat ~/.ssh/config

In case the file does already contain the following lines, add:

    Host lxplus*.cern.ch
        StrictHostKeyChecking no
        UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null

When you log into cmslpc, add a `-L` option to your ssh command:

    ssh -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 <YOUR USERNAME>@lxplus.cern.ch

Then you can make your area

```    
source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/cmsset_default.csh
cd nobackup/
mkdir -p CMSDAS2023/Trigger
cd CMSDAS2023/Trigger
cmsrel CMSSW_14_0_7
cd CMSSW_14_0_7/src
cmsenv
git clone https://github.com/marinakolosova/ShortExerciseTrigger2023.git
scram b -j 4
cd ShortExerciseTrigger2023/ShortExerciseTrigger
```

And start Jupyter with this command:

    jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888

After a pause (while lxplus loads the necessary libraries for the first time) you should see a message like the following:

    [I 11:30:05.670 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /afs/cern.ch/work/X/XXXX/cmsdas2023/nobackup/CMSDAS2023/Trigger/CMSSW_14_0_7/src
